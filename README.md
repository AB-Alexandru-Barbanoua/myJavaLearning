How I learned java.
In this github repository I have introduced all the exercises and practical projects that I have accomplished while learning this programming language.
I introduced the principles of oop and the basics of the java language. 
I also used mysql to create databases and connect them to the Java program that is made with the help of a special connector and the try chatch method.
